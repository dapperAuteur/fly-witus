## 3. Planned Features

### 3.1 High Priority (Next 3 Months)

#### P1: Digital Signature Capture
**Problem**: Pilots need legal proof of pre-flight completion  
**Solution**: Canvas-based signature pad with timestamp  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Touch/mouse signature input
- Auto-embed in PDF exports
- Secure storage (hashed, non-repudiable)
- Signature date/time logging

#### P2: Photo Attachments
**Problem**: Visual documentation missing (equipment damage, weather, hazards)  
**Solution**: Camera integration + photo storage  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Take photos within app (or upload from gallery)
- Attach to specific checklist items
- Compress images (max 500KB each)
- Include in PDF exports
- Limit: 5 photos per mission

#### P3: Offline Map Integration
**Problem**: Pilots manually check airspace restrictions  
**Solution**: Embedded map with no-fly zones  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Show 5-mile radius from current location
- Highlight airports, stadiums, restricted areas
- Work offline (cached tiles)
- Color-coded risk zones (red/yellow/green)
- Link to B4UFLY app for authorizations

#### P4: Pre-Flight Risk Assessment
**Problem**: No objective risk quantification  
**Solution**: Auto-calculate risk score (1-10)  
**Factors**:
- Weather (wind >15mph = +2, rain = +3)
- Time of day (dawn/dusk = +1, night = +2)
- Airspace (Class B/C = +3, uncontrolled = 0)
- Pilot experience (logged flight hours)
- Aircraft condition (battery health, maintenance due)

**Output**: Risk score + mitigation recommendations

#### P5: Maintenance Tracker
**Problem**: Pilots forget maintenance schedules  
**Solution**: Flight hour counter + alerts  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Log total flight hours per aircraft
- Set maintenance intervals (e.g., every 50 hours)
- Alert 5 hours before due
- Track: propeller replacements, firmware updates, sensor calibrations

### 3.2 Medium Priority (3-6 Months)

#### M1: Flight Time Calculator
Auto-compute elapsed time from takeoff/landing timestamps. Display in HH:MM:SS format.

#### M2: Battery Health Log
Track voltage trends over time. Flag batteries showing >10% degradation. Graph voltage over last 20 flights.

#### M3: Emergency Contacts
Quick-access list (ATC, local police, insurance). One-tap call/text. GPS location auto-share.

#### M4: Custom Checklist Items
Allow pilots to add site-specific or client-specific items. Support per-profile custom checklists.

#### M5: Multi-Language Support
Spanish, French for international operations. Auto-detect browser language.

### 3.3 Nice to Have (6-12 Months)

#### N1: Voice Notes
Record verbal observations during walk-around. Auto-transcribe to text. Attach to checklist items.

#### N2: Sunset/Sunrise Calculator
Auto-fetch based on GPS location. Warn if flight extends past civil twilight. Display golden hour times (aerial photography).

#### N3: Wind Speed Alerts
Compare current wind to aircraft specs. Warn if exceeding max rated wind speed. Show gust predictions.

#### N4: Batch Export to Excel
Export all missions as CSV/XLSX. Include pivot tables for analysis. Filter by date range, aircraft, location.

#### N5: Cloud Sync (Premium Feature)
Optional Google Drive/Dropbox backup. Real-time sync across devices. End-to-end encryption.

#### N6: Collaborative Missions
Multiple pilots share checklist. Visual observer can check specific items. Real-time updates via WebSockets.

#### N7: SMS/Email Reports
Auto-send mission summary to client. Branded email templates. Attach PDF checklist.

## 8. Appendix

### 8.1 User Feedback Themes
- "Need photos for insurance claims"
- "Forgot to log maintenance, need reminders"
- "Want to share checklist with visual observer"
- "Hard to check airspace restrictions on phone"

### 8.2 Competitor Analysis
- **Airdata UAV**: Focuses on flight analytics, not pre-flight checklists
- **DJI FlightHub**: Enterprise-focused, expensive, complex
- **Kittyhawk**: Discontinued (acquired by Aloft)
- **Aloft**: Airspace authorization, not checklist-focused

**Opportunity**: No competitor offers a free, offline-first, FAA-compliant checklist with modern UX.
